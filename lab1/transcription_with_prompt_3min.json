He wouldn't say yes or no, either. He'd always shirk making a choice. One fine day, his Aunt Josephine said to him, Now look here, no one will ever care for you if you carry on like this. You have no more mind of your own than a greasy old blade of grass. The young rat coughed and looked wise, as usual, but said nothing. Don't you think so? said his aunt, stamping with her foot, for she couldn't bear to see the young rats so cold-blooded. I don't know, was all he ever answered, and then he'd walk off to think for an hour more, whether he should stay in his hole in the ground or go out into the loft. One night, the rats heard a loud noise in the loft."

    "text": "It was a very, very old place. The roof let the rain come washing in. The beams and rafters had all rotten through, so that the whole thing was quite unsafe. At last one of the joists gave way, and the beams fell with one edge on the floor. The walls shook, the cupola fell off, and all the rats' hair stood on end with fear and horror. This won't do, said their leader. We can't stay cooped up here any longer. So they sent out scouts to search for a new home. A little later on that evening, the scouts came back and said they had found an old-fashioned horse barn where there would be room and board for all of them. The leader gave the order at once. Company fall in. And the rats crawled out of their holes right away and stood on the floor in a long line. Just then the old rat caught sight of young Arthur."
